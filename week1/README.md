# WEEK1

## Introduction to 'Slave to the Algorithm' studio

Before the actual class I looked up what generative design is and what is an algorithm. To summarise my brief research on these terms. 'Generative design' meant number of different design outcomes produced from a set of rule/constraints, and 'Algorithm' meant a method.
##
We were divided into groups to experience and experiment how generative design works. We utilised dice (in my case I used a virtual dice to roll) to determine what kind of possibilities we could come up with after setting up our own parameters. My group came up with 'what', 'how' and 'where' method to produce scribble drawing outcomes. In the process we utilised our body to create them which was hard and involved a physical labor. Outcomes were very random and imperfect so I raised question whether the computer take imperfection as one of the infinite outcomes, and the answer was 'yes'. I thought humans are imaginative enough because we were imperfect but the fact that the computer can embrace that failures as one of their results, it feels like human labors are going to become meaningless. I find this interesting and I was encouraged to research a 'breaking system'.

## Research
After discussing with Karen about glitch and system breaking design I was introduced to ["The Glitch Moment(um)" by Rosa Menkman](http://digbeyond.com/readme/view.php?id=104&course=Generative%20Design) to have a read of. Rosa Menkman is a Dutch visualist, theorist and curator, working with glitches, compressions, feedback and other forms of noise artifacts, aiming to contribute to the development of a discourse for glitch art and culture. The book was combination of research projects and writings where it talks about the glitch as a genre, glitch cultural aesthetics, and artists related to the realm. “Unaccepted… unwanted… unordered”. I really like her description of the glitch process and glitch art that it is not understood by people. I was drawn into the uncertainty and rejected genre. I was also highly influenced by Menkman cites McLuhan’s adage that “obsolescence never meant the end of anything, it’s just the beginning” accepting the failure as another genre to explore and another challenge to take on.

The eerie vibe and discomfort the video creates is very inspiring and make me believe its beautiful yet something so far to accept. As a designer I find her works a good example of 'subjective' multimedia art piece where failures/broken find its new name.
