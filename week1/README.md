## Introduction to 'Slave to the Algorithm' studio

Before the actual class I looked up what generative design is and what is an algorithm. To summarise my brief research on these terms. 'Generative design' meant number of different design outcomes produced from a set of rule/constraints, and 'Algorithm' meant a method.
##
We were divided into groups to experience and experiment how generative design works. We utilised dice (in my case I used a virtual dice to roll) to determine what kind of possibilities we could come up with after setting up our own parameters. My group came up with 'what', 'how' and 'where' method to produce scribble drawing outcomes. In the process we utilised our body to create them which was hard and involved a physical labor. Outcomes were very random and imperfect so I raised question whether the computer take imperfection as one of the infinite outcomes, and the answer was 'yes'. I thought humans are imaginative enough because we were imperfect but the fact that the computer can embrace that failures as one of their results, as to human labors, it feels like it is going to become meaningless. I find this interesting and I was encouraged to research a 'breaking system'.

After discussing with Karen about glitch and system breaking design I was introduced to ["The Glitch Moment(um)" by Rosa Menkman](http://digbeyond.com/readme/view.php?id=104&course=Generative%20Design) to have a read of.
