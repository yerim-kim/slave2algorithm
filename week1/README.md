# Week 1:

We were divided into groups to experience and experiment how generative design works. We utilised dice (in my case I used a virtual dice to roll) to determine what kind of possibilities we could come up with after setting up our own parameters. / My group came up with what, how and where method to produce scribble outcomes. In the process we utilised our body to create them which was hard and involved physical labor. Outcomes were very random and imperfect so I raised question whether the computer take imperfection as one of the 100 outcomes, and the answer was yes. I thought humans are imaginative enough because we were imperfect but the fact that the computer can embrace that failures as one of their results human labors become meaningless. I find this interesting and I was encouraged to research 'breaking system'.
