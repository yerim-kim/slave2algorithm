Project Title: Generative Data Art Using Game Network/Frequency

Inspiration: In Your Face (Collagen)

[MHOX](http://mhoxdesign.com/collagene-en.html)
A design research group
In your face is one of their gen data work. This
project explores the border territory between
physical and virtual, connecting computer code’s
abstractions with the intimate dimension of body
alteration’s sense brought by the mask theme.
I was inspired by their use of human face data to
generate a custom made mask for each people.
Through MHOX project I was drawn into gen
data art practice and decide to explore this
concept in my own way.

Aim: To share and communicate what I enjoy more easily to other by converting into an art piece.

Case Studies: 

1. REFIK ANADOL

[Melting Memories](http://refikanadol.com/works/meltingmemories/)

Refik Anadol is a media artist and
director who also created impactful gen
data art, such as ‘Melting Memories.’
Using complex EEG device, for complex
neuroscience research, connecting
human brain to look for the pattern of
remembering. Once they gathered large
amount of memory data, with designed
code they generated 3D relive of those
memories.

2. KIRELL BENZI

[Deep Sea & These Are Not Flowers!](https://www.kirellbenzi.com/)

Kirell Benzi is a data artist and data
visualization lecturer. Many of his work
involve generative system. Such as, ‘Deep
sea’ and ‘This is Not Flowers!’ Deep Sea
explores the augmentation of the sea
level from January 1993 to April 2018.
Using that data to produce randomised,
generative patterns. ‘This is Not Flowers!’
was constructed by a neural network,
trained from 1 million pictures. Once
trained, the network can recreate up to
1000 different objects.

## Feedback
-it would be more engaging if you are able to incorporate music with the artwork, it might be able to resonate with different audiences.

-You could add Stelarc's "Ping Body" to your research as many scholars have written about this work

## Reflection
After the presentation and looking at other student's presentations I strongly felt that I wasn't certain about my current project.
