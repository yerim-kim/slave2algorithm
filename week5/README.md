Project Title: Generative Data Art Using Game Network/Frequency

Inspiration: In Your Face (Collagen)

Aim: To share and communicate what I enjoy more easily to other by converting into an art piece.

Game Frequency >> Processing >> 3D rendered Art piece >> Possbily into music too

## Feedback
-it would be more engaging if you are able to incorporate music with the artwork, it might be able to resonate with different audiences.

-You could add Stelarc's "Ping Body" to your research as many scholars have written about this work
