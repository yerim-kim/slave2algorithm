# WEEK6
## Project Discussion/ Paper Prototyping/ Processing Class Acitivity

We were divided into a similar project group to help each other and give feedback of our projects. Here I was still unsure what my project will change into so I continued to talk about Game Data Art and also share that I'm thinking of changing my project to something else. I went around the different group to hear and get inspired for my new project. I was strongly gravitate towards the sonification room but their projects were a little different from what I thought sonification was. I thought it would be composing music algorithmically.

Back to the project, I got a feedback and suggestion from Luka and Andy. Luka suggested me about [Artist Simon Weckert](http://simonweckert.com/googlemapshacks.html), who outsmarted Google Maps by using a handcart full of smartphones to trick the app's algorithm into creating a virtual traffic jam. Luka suggested this when I was talking ping and travelling information. The artist's approach was interesting and his intention was to make changes in the physical world by using digital means.

Andy also shared his opinions in ping. He suggested me about the installation art where we can view informations travelling in the real time by hearing bell ringing when the information arrives.

### Retro Game Paper Prototyping - Andy

Andy taught us about communicating our ideas to industry that we shouldn't just write about how our project is going to be but it is better to communicate our idea through a (paper) protyping, a something tangible to present how my project potentially looks like and work.
So, in this exercise we were asked to make 2D paper prototype of our choosen retro games to show how it work. I think it's really good way to understand how our project going to work in real life and understanding the possible problems. Or even less presure to start the project this way than going into the code first thing.

### Data Sonification Research

After the Karen's lecture I started researching deeply into data sonification. In the process I found a few inspiring practitioners who successed in converting a complex data into music.

1. [Data Sonata by julien levesque](http://www.julienlevesque.net/Data_Sonata/index-en.html)


2. [Quotidian Record (2012) Brian House](https://brianhouse.net/works/quotidian_record/)
