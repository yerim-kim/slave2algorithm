# WEEK6
## Project Rethinking/ Paper Prototyping/ Processing Class Acitivity

We were divided into a similar project group to help each other and give feedback of our projects. Here I was still unsure what my project will change into so I continued to talk about Game Data Art and also share that I'm thinking of changing my project to something else. I went around the different group to hear and get inspired for my new project. I was strongly gravitate towards the sonification room but their projects were a little different from what I thought sonification was. I thought it would be composing music algorithmically.

Back to the project, I got a feedback and suggestion from Luka and Andy. Luka suggested me about [Artist Simon Weckert](http://simonweckert.com/googlemapshacks.html), who outsmarted Google Maps by using a handcart full of smartphones to trick the app's algorithm into creating a virtual traffic jam. Luka suggested this when I was talking ping and travelling information. The artist's approach was interesting and his intention was to make changes in the physical world by using digital means.
