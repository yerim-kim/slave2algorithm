# WEEK2

### Pop-up Activity : 12-hour challenge
Before week2 class we were given activity challenge our daily system by 'carefully observing', applying rules and parameters with decision making system such as a dice. Like any human daily life I chose to challenge 'eating' and processes involving around the meal time.

First I start off from whether to eat or not eat at all (skipping meal) with coin (1/2 and 1/2 chances) then in order to make choices complex and bring chaos in decision making I decided to apply varieties of options and dice (6sides) to roll my daily system. So as a result I end up eating Japanese takeaway food with soup.
## Instructional Art and First Step in Processing
In today's class we were introduced to code basic shapes on Processing. Line, circle, square and more. Even though they were simple shapes I felt it was challenging, especailly positioning them accoridng to x and y axis. Then we were asked to create self-portrait of ourselves. The outcome of mine and others were funny and interesting. I really enjoyed drawing my hair using mouse X and Y.

## Research
Other than expanding my research into Glitch I was also gravitate towards algorithmic artists such as Samuel Monnier and Roman Verostko who were mentioned during the class. During the research I was once again think about the term and meaning of 'Algorithm'. An algorithm may be viewed simply as a detailed recipe for carrying out a task. The term has its origin in mathematics as the step by step procedure for solving a problem. The  commonplace procedures we use for multiplying and dividing numbers are algorithms. With precise details for each step the procedures yield the same result whether executed by a computer or by a human. This is why robots are able to handle many tasks that were once done only by humans.

My thoughts were conflicted and challenged because this is away from traditional method of drawing. Even though humands wrote the algorithm so machine can learn it and create beautiful and unique output its not something that the artist drew. This thought process remind me of contemporary artist Jeff Koons who have factory of employed artist to draw his idea for him. Is this art considered as his?

Back to algorithm art. I find algorithm art unconventional because humans take years or even all their life to learn skills to master but by inputting algorithm and rules into the AI it's quick to learn and even quickly apply into a new outcome. Less labor required and even creating unseen art pieces. Drawing new stroke to the contemporary art.
