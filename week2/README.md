# WEEK2
## Instructional Art and First Step in Processing

### Pop-up Activity : 12-hour challenge
Before week2 class we were given activity challenge our daily system by 'carefully observing', applying rules and parameters with decision making system such as a dice. Like any human daily life I chose to challenge 'eating' and processes involving around the meal time.

First I start off from whether to eat or not eat at all (skipping meal) with coin (1/2 and 1/2 chances) then in order to make choices complex and bring chaos in decision making I decided to apply varieties of options and dice (6sides) to roll my daily system. So as a result I end up eating Japanese takeaway food with soup.

In today's class we were introduced to code basic shapes on Processing. Line, circle, square and more. Even though they were simple shapes I felt it was challenging, especailly positioning them accoridng to x and y axis. Then we were asked to create self-portrait of ourselves. The outcome of mine and others were funny and interesting. I really enjoyed drawing my hair using mouse X and Y.
