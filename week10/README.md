## WEEK10

### Pixelating image with Processing - Further experimenting from week 9
After milestone I found more ways to pixelate my images. This code was made by [Jeff Thompson]{https://github.com/yerim-kim/slave2algorithm/blob/master/week10/pixelating.pde}
["After an afternoon of working on a Processing project with Alex Myers, I created a Processing sketch that pixelates and posterizes an image.  Next step (and definitely the hardest) will be to find the weighted center of the pixel areas (not each pixel block but areas of the same color).  The above image is Van Gogh’s “Starry Night”.] (https://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2012/02/18/pixelate-and-posterize-in-processing/)

I'm not sure I will use the Start button like that or just use mouse clicking function. I will try both and work out which one is better
