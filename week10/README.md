### Pixelating image with Processing - Further experimenting from week 9
After milestone I found more ways to pixelate my images. This code was made by [Jeff Thompson](https://github.com/yerim-kim/slave2algorithm/blob/master/week10/pixelating.pde)
"After an afternoon of working on a Processing project with Alex Myers, I created a Processing sketch that [pixelates and posterizes](https://www.jeffreythompson.org/blog/2012/02/18/pixelate-and-posterize-in-processing/) an image.  Next step (and definitely the hardest) will be to find the weighted center of the pixel areas (not each pixel block but areas of the same color).

From his web blog I have read and understood that he was also working on code to find the value of the image pixels (of similar colours). This proves that my method so far is the right path to convert an image to array of numbers.

### Building Website using OpenProcessing P5.js
From last week I got really started on exploring and learning code in p5.js, so I could build an interactive web platform to take my next step of "[image > pixelation > number > music] move to working web". I employed p5.js online version synced with my Github account because I find it easy to get the fast response to the code results and experiment with code using multiple editors open. 
I mainly explored things that make up the website such as button and transition to a landing page from main page. When I was building these codes I referred to the Youtube tutorial ["p5.js How to display text menu before game starts"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgHhEzKlLb4) by Magic Monk.

I'm not sure I will use the Start button like that or just use mouse clicking function. I will try both and work out which one is better
