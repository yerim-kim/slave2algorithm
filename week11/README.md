### After Consultation

Being honest about where I was stuck in the was what I needed to go to image pixelation step. During the consultation Karen helped me out so much so I can get my code working to get an pixel image. She also make sure to explain what is happening with the code so I can understand and follow along. A below result is from image pixels converted into larger common brightness pixel value in a rectangle form according to pixel size of 70.

I still need to work out the positioning of the rectangles.

### Where to from here...

After Friday class I was still struggling to extract pixel brightness values out from the image and convert them into sound. I thought in order to move on from a no progress situation to at least trying something else. I try to code a section by section, dividing the code into different p5.js files. So as a result I ended up with 4 different a mixture of p5.js file and java files.
