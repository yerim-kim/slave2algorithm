# WEEK4

## Processing Intense Class/ Refining Project Pitch

In today's class we were fully committed to developing our Processing skills. Karen taught us how to import an image into our sketch folder and play with the image, also including fonts and creating short a rotating animation with texts.

Even though some of the codes were hard to follow I found myself really enjoying corporating an image and texts into coding. Code with an image we learnt how to apply the "random" function (my favourite word relate to this studio). I think learning this function was really important to me not only because it's fun to play with but since the aim of my project is creating chaos, aka randomness.
