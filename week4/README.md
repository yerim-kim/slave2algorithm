# WEEK4

## Processing Intense/ Refining Project Pitch

In today's class we were fully committed to developing our Processing skills. Karen taught us how to import an image into our sketch folder and play with the image, also including fonts and creating short a rotating animation with texts.

Even though some of the codes were hard to follow I found myself really enjoying corporating an image and texts into coding. Code with an image we learnt how to apply the "random" function (my favourite word relate to this studio). I think learning this function was really important to me not only because it's fun to play with but since the aim of my project is creating chaos, aka randomness.

Also depending on the location of the mouse X,Y we made the sketch that make image appeal faster and slower. Dots were appealing faster when I placed my mouse right side and slower when I moved to left side of the tab.

I also found codes used to make below outcomes useful. Rotate was the most noticeble one that I thought I can use it for my future project because it's really cool effect and rotating animation trigger disturbance effect that I like. Karen also taught us how to make things fade so the background doesn't become crowded.
