# WEEK3

## Non-human drawing/ Rules-based Design/ Hunting and Gathering

Today we focused away from the computer and explored ways of deferring agency to a system by experimenting and collaborating things from real life. In an hour we were asked to make non-human drawing machine from what's around us. I couldn't find anything at the start but then I decide to do some laundry and utilise the energy produced from the machine.

#### First Attempt

Materials: Started Washing Machine, pastels, strings, scissors and a piece of paper

I hang pastels onto the vibrating washing machine using strings. Also taped the paper on the side of the washing machine. I imagined pastels will start to move and drawing on the A3 paper depending on the vibration intensity. But the washing machine vibrancy was not strong enough to make pastels move. My first attempt totally failed. I tried to reposition pastels still utilising the washing machine.


#### Attempt 2 & 3

More trials and errors. I decide to move the pastels and hang from above of the washing machine and A3 paper taped on top of the washing machine but pastels still did not budge at all due to the weak vibrancy. Then I gave up the string and let pastels feel the vibrancy directly by just placing them right onto the taped A3 paper on top of the washing machine. When the third attempt failed I realised how stable the washing machine is compare to the sound it makes..haha.

Finally, I went bold and put the pastels inside the moving washing machine. Pastels and folded A3 paper inside the zip-lock bag going round and round in the washin machine. Result being successful, but not as abstract and expressive outcome I was looking for.

#### Final Attempt

Materials: A3 paper, pastels, strings and a trolly bag

On my final attempt I used trolly but I was driving the force so it's not completely non-human drawing.

## Research & Hunting and Gathering

My research started from glitch --> An algorithm art --> generated chaotic designs inspired by [Che Yu Wu's Circular System.](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/916659) I'm still drawn to generative art that is random, chaotic, insane and colourful work. Che Yu Wu's work was reflecting something close to what I think my future project will be where I can find 'ordered chaos' or 'systemic chaos'. Randomly generated colors and geomatric shapes create focal point circling around the black background and constantly changing its' patterns which draw people into the middle of the circular system even more.

A Korean American contemporary artist Nam June Paik's television-based art caught my eyes when I was researching 'ordered chaos'. Especially his 'Continental U.S' made up of neon light and flashing retro televisions forming U.S map created vibrant yet ordered atmosphere for viewers.

From researches so far I started to narrow down what kind of a project pitch I want to undertake. 'A randomly generated chaos' is the theme I'm looking at.
