# WEEK3

## Non-human drawing/ Rules-based Design/ Hunting and Gathering

Today we focused away from the computer and explored ways of deferring agency to a system by experimenting and collaborating things from real life. In an hour we were asked to make non-human drawing machine from what's around us. I couldn't find anything at the start but then I decide to do some laundry and utilise the energy produced from the machine.

#### First Attempt

Materials: Started Washing Machine, pastels, strings, scissors and a piece of paper
