## REFLECTION
Coding? Generative Designs? Algorithms? 

It was full of questions and uncertainty at the start of the studio, but I would have never imagined myself creating a digital music that intended to explore the therapeutic effect using sound. Even with limited class time and having zero knowledge behind the coding, I was still able to experience and appreciate the Front-End development, UX/UI design, the design practices that I wanted to pursue but never got a chance to engage with until now. Learn to code and undertaking the project with a timeline in the studio was indeed overwhelming and stressful in some degree. But it was a meaningful process and experience to expand my horizon as a multidisciplinary designer.

CODING: the process or activity of writing computer programs.

Learn to code...
* in Open processing
* in P5.js
* Interactive website

The pivotal part of this studio was about the utilisation of the newly learnt skills in the project. Recording of weekly entries in Github also illustrates that it is about the process. Often in the design field that many attentions are drawn more to the outcome than the effort and thinking processes. Even though I said “my priority is on the process and the learning involved during the project” in the pitch PDF, I also found myself walking the path of favouring the result. And only to realise now, week 13, that it was about the journey of ‘trial and error’ and exploring generative design. Learning about parametric design was an eye-opening moment for me. I have never composed music before, and now I can produce a unique sound not only for myself but also for others. I have come to realise the infinite possibilities of generative design that can affect various career fields.
