### Research

A most stunning data sonification work done by Katja Striedelmeyer for "Beyond Heatmaps â€” Data visualization for a warming planet". "Listen: Apple Blossom is Shifting" project presents a sonification of the shifting beginning of the apple blossom in Germany. This dataset was sonified using a mechanical music box, with ascending pitch indicating the increasingly earlier blossoming. The sound of the mechanical music box is indescribale, beautiful and delicate. This was the type of project I was searching for and I am truly inspired by the inifinite possibility to represent the data. It is definitely more than a music but a music with story, knowledge and background. I love the details of how it is all been handmade and well made music box music sheet going on a loop.

### Paper Prototype

At first I was going to use the corona spreading in Melbourne data to create a music but then I realised it's too negative and give an idea of 'death' to the audience. I liked this idea though because this is something continuous so the music will only end when the corona is completely gone in Melbourne. Also very generative as well since the data can't be foreseen but only to be estimated. So we won't know what kind of sound it will produce.

So I decide to change my project direction completely to 'images covert into music box music' so it gives a hope instead of despair. Personally I find music boxes represent the reminiscent of the past memories. {But people can think of a music box as whatever they like.} My first paper prototype shows how I want to create a music box music from images before corona.
Images are made up of numbers once they are transferred digitally then I can use converted number data to create a music sheet for a music box.
