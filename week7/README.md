# WEEK7

## Quick presentation/Paper prototyping/Pseudo Code

### Paper Prototype 1

At first I was going to use the corona spreading in Melbourne data to create a music but then I realised it's too negative and give an idea of 'death' to the audience. I liked this idea though because this is something continuous so the music will only end when the corona is completely gone in Melbourne. Also very generative as well since the data can't be foreseen but only to be estimated. So we won't know what kind of sound it will produce.

So I decide to change my project direction completely to 'images covert into music box music' so it gives a hope instead of despair. Personally I find music boxes represent the reminiscent of the past memories. {But people can think of a music box as whatever they like.} My first paper prototype shows how I want to create a music box music from images before corona.
Fact that images are made up of numbers when they are transferred into a digital form then using that number data to create a music sheet for a music box.

## Created a paper prototype after the quick presentation & feedback from Karen
