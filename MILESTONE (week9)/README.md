# MILESTONE (WEEK9)

This week we had a milestone short presentation of our projects. We got to see where everyone else is up to and got a feedback on what direction we need to go with our project.
I didn't get to say everything in the presentation but here I will write the details of how I'm going with my project, 'Remember U'.

So After realising that I need to pixelate the image in order to get the right amount of pixel numbers for conversion. I utilised code from this website (https://byrodrigo.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/pixelate-with-processing/) to control the pixelation. Then I saw there are numbers appeal in Console that represent each brigtness pixels in the donut picutre.

I copied all the necessary numbers into Notepad app and manually tidy them up so it looks like the numbers below with commas.

225,88,31,191,171,150,145,21,255,229,240,244,195,127,117,144,25,255,217,222,199,178,119,150,138,59,255,218,255,146,165,127,171,174,51,255,222,234,241,162,135,163,190,21,255,224,254,196,185,122,149,136,23,255,226,217,218,186,186,128,147,173,255,229,226,230,185,155,134,127,87,255,223,201,255,196,254,232,217,85,255,189,102,210,195,185,236,244,92

##
Then utilising ['Musical Algorithms' website](http://musicalgorithms.org/4.1/app/) I applied optional parametics allowed in the website to convert those numbers to 88 notes in a piano and furthermore convert them into a music genre to my taste.

#### Reflection?
Using the already made data sonification website I had a successful outcome of making piano sounds out of an image. Through this precious music outcome I was able to reconsider my final deliverable need to be. Like how above website create user experience and creating a moment through their step by step converting numbers to music I also want to employ that rapport with my potential users. I want them to have a experience and moment of their time where they conver their own image by themselves. I want to have that interactive moment as a designer publishing a website with meaning. I changed a small part of my projects such as I dropped music box part and selling music box at all because after hearing my unique music created from number I realised that having a sound is the important aspect of this project.

##
I created a mood board and a concept board for my website if I get to make one. I wanted to utilise blue analogue colours and pastel tones to make my website appeal calming, tranquil and therapuetic mood of healing through music. This is experimental so I think it will definitely change during the coding process.

##
My next step is to make this process of image to music a lot smoother using p5.js.
