# MILESTONE (WEEK9)

This week we had a milestone short presentation of our projects. We got to see where everyone else is up to and got a feedback what direction we need to go with our project.
I didn't get to say everything in the presentation but here I will write the details of how I'm going with my project, 'Remember U'.

So After realising that I need to pixelate the image in order to get the right amount of pixel numbers for conversion. I utilised code from this website (https://byrodrigo.wordpress.com/2010/09/24/pixelate-with-processing/) to control the pixelation. Then I found out there are numbers in Console that represent each pixels in the donut picutre.

I copied all the necessary numbers into Notepad app and manually tidy them up so it looks like the numbers below with commas.

225,88,31,191,171,150,145,21,255,229,240,244,195,127,117,144,25,255,217,222,199,178,119,150,138,59,255,218,255,146,165,127,171,174,51,255,222,234,241,162,135,163,190,21,255,224,254,196,185,122,149,136,23,255,226,217,218,186,186,128,147,173,255,229,226,230,185,155,134,127,87,255,223,201,255,196,254,232,217,85,255,189,102,210,195,185,236,244,92

Then utilising 'Musical Algorithms' website (http://musicalgorithms.org/4.1/app/) I convert those numbers to 88 notes in a piano.

I had a successful outcome of making piano sounds out of an image.

I created a mood board and a concept board for my website if I get to make one. I wanted to utilise calm blue colours and include playful elements such as line doodles to lighten up the mood of the website.

My next step is to make this process of image to music a lot smoother using p5.js.
